// Model a bookshop inventory program to maintain the inventory of books. The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher, stock position etc. Whenever
// the customer wants a book, the shopkeeper inputs the title and the authorâ€™s name of
// the book and the system replies whether it is in the list or not. If it is in the list, then
// the system displays the book details and asks for the number of copies. If the
// requested copies are available, the total cost of the books is displayed. Use the
// concept of passing structures to functions.
